# supernapietheme

The theme for supernapie

This is a Magento2 theme.

It is built for a Belgian/Dutch site, so it has some hardcoded translations in Dutch in it.

Also if you plan on using it, i would appreciate if you replaced the footer image and other logo's with your own (They are also hardcoded).

## Installation

Inside the root of your Magento2 installation:

    cd app/design/frontend
    mkdir Webwolk
    cd Webwolk
    git submodule add git@github.com:Quinten/supernapietheme.git

Done!

Now you can enable it in the backend.
